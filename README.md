# The base of software engineer

----
This roadmap was created for my own study goals.

The main ridge of the road map has been taken from the [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
also, I added links to additional resources that recommended [that guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-tlxRa-MP4) and [that guy ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ijMUXRtnZQ) Finally, I added my collections of resources on what I recommend to pass or what i plan to study in the future.

PS. If you want to discuss something with me you can find me in:
- telegram @ishmitov
- discord dmitr2ish
- or you can connect to our [server](https://discord.gg/ycPef6XS) where we study programming
