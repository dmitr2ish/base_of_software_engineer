# The base of software engineer

----
This roadmap was created for my own study goals.

The main ridge of the road map has been taken from the [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/), 
also I added links to additional resources that recommended [that guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-tlxRa-MP4). 
Finally, I added my own collections of resources on what I recommend to pass or what i plan to study in the future.
